This is where L, the world’s greatest detective, meticulously examines every detail, searching for patterns that might lead him to Kira. Participants step into this realm, embodying L's investigative spirit. Armed with a dataset filled with clues—crime statistics, social media activity, and more—they must analyze the information to uncover trends that could reveal Kira's next move. With five questions to answer, teams work frantically, applying statistical methods to determine which day had the highest crime rates or uncovering the most prevalent social media interactions.

Each task reveals a clue that will bring them closer to escaping the room, just as Kira carefully orchestrates his moves to outwit L. Teams tackle the first challenge of handling missing values, filling in gaps to ensure data integrity. Next, they confront duplicates, stripping away redundancy to present a unique dataset. Outlier detection becomes a race against time as they identify anomalies, while data type conversion ensures every piece of information is in its rightful format.

With a 3x3 Bingo card in hand, participants engage in a flurry of creativity. They tackle a variety of visualization challenges—from pie charts to scatter plots—working together to communicate trends and insights that could change the game. As they complete three tasks in a row and call “Bingo!”, the anticipation builds.
