Each team will have a limited time (eg, 3-5 minutes) to observe the video in each round.   After the observation, they will have another 1-2 minutes to discuss and submit their guess for the cause of the fault.   Teams can submit only one or two guesses per round.   Guesses must be concise, focusing on the specific technical fault.   No external aids or devices are allowed to research the fault during the event.

Once they have the answer, they must signal by “capturing the flag,” which could be represented by pressing a buzzer or raising a flag.   Only the first team or individual to capture the flag may answer each question.   Participants should answer immediately upon capturing the flag. They have a limited time (eg, 30 seconds) to provide a clear, concise answer.   If the answer is correct, the team earns points. If incorrect, the question will be reopened for other participants to attempt.   Correct answers earn points based on question difficulty.   The first team to reach the predetermined target score wins the event.   In case of a tie, an additional round with a tiebreaker question will determine the winner.   Participants are not allowed to use external aids or resources during the event.   Any team that fails to answer within the time limit loses their turn for that question.   No team is allowed to communicate with other teams.   If a team is found discussing with others or using unauthorized materials, they will be disqualified from the event",

The event is open to undergraduate students pursuing electrical, electronics, or related engineering courses.  Materials provided include simulation software licenses or hardware components for circuit design. The design must be original and created during the event; pre-designed circuits or plagiarized work will lead to disqualification. Teams must submit their circuit design and debugging solution within the given time frame. Teams can choose either simulation software or hardware (as per the event's setup) to design the circuit",

Unauthorized assistance includes seeking help from external sources during the event.Design accuracy is crucial; the circuit must meet all the given design requirements. Creativity will be rewarded, as innovative use of components or creative design approaches can earn bonus points. Efficiency is important; teams must fix faults in the debug phase within the allotted time, with quick and accurate fixes scoring higher. Presentation and teams should be able to explain their design and debug process clearly to the judges",

Participants step into this realm, embodying L's investigative spirit. Armed with a dataset filled with clues—crime statistics, social media activity, and more—they must analyze the information to uncover trends that could reveal Kira's next move. With five questions to answer, teams work frantically, applying statistical methods to determine which day had the highest crime rates or uncovering the most prevalent social media interactions.

Each task reveals a clue that will bring them closer to escaping the room, just as Kira carefully orchestrates his moves to outwit L. Teams tackle the first challenge of handling missing values, filling in gaps to ensure data integrity. Next, they confront duplicates, stripping away redundancy to present a unique dataset. Outlier detection becomes a race against time as they identify anomalies, while data type conversion ensures every piece of information is in its rightful format.

With a 3x3 Bingo card in hand, participants engage in a flurry of creativity. They tackle a variety of visualization challenges—from pie charts to scatter plots—working together to communicate trends and insights that could change the game.
