Each team will have a limited time (eg, 3-5 minutes) to observe the video in each round.   After the observation, they will have another 1-2 minutes to discuss and submit their guess for the cause of the fault.   Teams can submit only one or two guesses per round.   Guesses must be concise, focusing on the specific technical fault.   No external aids or devices are allowed to research the fault during the event.

Only the first team or individual to capture the flag may answer each question.   Participants should answer immediately upon capturing the flag. They have a limited time (eg, 30 seconds) to provide a clear, concise answer.   If the answer is correct, the team earns points. If incorrect, the question will be reopened for other participants to attempt.   Correct answers earn points based on question difficulty.   The first team to reach the predetermined target score wins the event.   In case of a tie, an additional round with a tiebreaker question will determine the winner.   Participants are not allowed to use external aids or resources during the event.   Any team that fails to answer within the time limit loses their turn for that question.

Round 2: London Bridge Is Falling Down (Score: 70 marks) .  This round is a hands-on challenge where participants will construct a truss-type bridge. Materials : Each team will be given a limited supply of newspapers, along with glue and rubber bands to build their bridge. Structure : The bridge should be a truss type and must meet specific dimension requirements provided at the start of the round. Testing : The constructed bridges will undergo a load test to assess their strength, as well as a dimension test to ensure they meet the set criteria. Winner Selection : The teams whose bridges pass both the load and dimension tests will be declared the winners ",

All pilots must follow the race rules; any violation of the rules will result in immediate disqualification of the participant.As mentioned, the race course can be indoor or outdoor. The track may be narrower, which will determine the level of capability and robustness required from the drone. There can be sections of the track where the drone is restricted to an altitude of 75 cm or even lower. Some sections will test the drone's ability to move both forward and backward. Hitting any obstacles will incur penalties, such as added time to your overall race time.

Materials provided include simulation software licenses or hardware components for circuit design. The design must be original and created during the event; pre-designed circuits or plagiarized work will lead to disqualification. Teams must submit their circuit design and debugging solution within the given time frame. Teams can choose either simulation software or hardware (as per the event's setup) to design the circuit",

Unauthorized assistance includes seeking help from external sources during the event.Design accuracy is crucial; the circuit must meet all the given design requirements. Creativity will be rewarded, as innovative use of components or creative design approaches can earn bonus points. Efficiency is important; teams must fix faults in the debug phase within the allotted time, with quick and accurate fixes scoring higher.

Participants step into this realm, embodying L's investigative spirit. Armed with a dataset filled with clues—crime statistics, social media activity, and more—they must analyze the information to uncover trends that could reveal Kira's next move. With five questions to answer, teams work frantically, applying statistical methods to determine which day had the highest crime rates or uncovering the most prevalent social media interactions.

Each task reveals a clue that will bring them closer to escaping the room, just as Kira carefully orchestrates his moves to outwit L. Teams tackle the first challenge of handling missing values, filling in gaps to ensure data integrity. Next, they confront duplicates, stripping away redundancy to present a unique dataset. Outlier detection becomes a race against time as they identify anomalies, while data type conversion ensures every piece of information is in its rightful format.

With a 3x3 Bingo card in hand, participants engage in a flurry of creativity. They tackle a variety of visualization challenges—from pie charts to scatter plots—working together to communicate trends and insights that could change the game. As they complete three tasks in a row and call “Bingo!”, the anticipation builds. They present their visualizations to the judges, explaining how each chart uncovers a deeper understanding of the data. In this moment, the power of insight becomes their ultimate weapon",
